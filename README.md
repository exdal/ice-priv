# IceSDK

IceSDK is a cold little Game SDK to create games. You can use individuel parts or
just use it as a Game Engine itself.

# v0.0.0a
- I wrote rendering part and rewrote file system, mempler wrote the every other code including github stuff.

# v0.0.0b
Todo:
 - Animations, use some timer to update sprites using the batch renderer.

## How to setup

Setting things up is quite easy, you simply go ahead and run following commands:

```shell
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/IceSDK/IceSDK


# Generate IDE Specific files
# those are the supported args:
# --ide=(`vscode`, `vs2017`, `vs2019`) --target?=(`android`, `emscripten`)
# though android doesn't really work right now.
python3 ./tools/setup.py --ide=vscode
```
